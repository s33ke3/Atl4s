----------------------------------Change log. Ver 1.7-------------------------------------

--> Implemented .json to optimize the visualization of the logs of the submitted request

--> Management of flags via Array

--> Added a polling service for sending flags

--> Generated a file to send "flagsToSubmit"

--> Added the sleep time for sending the group of flags to the game server

--> Added sleep time to "SleepServiceSecond" configuration file


----------------------------------Change log. Ver 1.5-------------------------------------

--> Added a continuous cycle every 120 seconds by default. And added the possibility to set it from configuration file

--> Implemented the regex to find the flag in the entire output file, by removing the ^ character at the beginning and $ at the end (regardless of the characters, before or after)
 
--> Fixed Bug in submitted flag.txt name

--> Deleted the output file of each individual exploit (after it has been analyzed for catch the flag)

-----------------------------------ChangeLog.End.------------------------------------------


///////////////////////////////////////FLOW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

N.B The same cycle is repeated (Ver.1.5)

-> For each exploit in the "exploitList.txt" list (and contained in the / Exploits folder):
   --> Execute the exploit in a separate "Shell process"
        --> on all the IPs in the "iplist.txt" list


-> For each output generated by the execution of the exploits:
    --> Analyze if it finds the flag (via the regex)

-> For each flag found:
   
   -> Write the flag in the flagsToSubmit file
  
   -> When the sumbmit service does the first round it makes a copy of the flagsToSubmit file
       -> Send flagsToSubmit to the Game Server
       -> Clean the flagsToSubmit file
       -> Waits for a Sleep time (default is 3 seconds)
	   
*************************************HOW TO USE*********************************************


1. Set the parameters of the Atl4s.config configuration file:
   
   - Insert Path of the API (Game Server) for submitting the flag
   - Insert Path of the folder with the exploits (default Exploit /)
   - Insert Path to the Outputs folder
   - Insert Sleep time to repeat the cycle (default is 120 sec.) Ver. 1.5
   - Insert Log File, if specified, redirects main output to a log file
   - Insert Flag regex
   - Insert Team Token

2. Load the python Exploits into the Exploits folder

3. Create the iplist.txt file with the target ip's

4. Run Atl4s.py	
	
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||SECTIONS|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||


Atl4s.py         --> Main
Atl4s.config     --> Configuration File
functions.py     --> File with the Check functions of the Flag with the regex, and pass them to flag array
submitService.py --> File with the Submit functions of the Fleg.
iplist.txt       --> File with the list of ip to attack


Folder -> Exploits:
                 - Folder that contains all exploits in python
                 - File "exploitList.txt": list of exploits to be executed (name.py [ip] list of additional parameters
                   N.B [ip] is a constant Eg buffer.py [ip] 9999

Folder -> Outputs: location of the programs's output (from shell), with the following format: filenameexploit_targetIP_executiondate.txt
